LASSO regression is NOT robust toward outliers compared to linear regression.
High degree feature expansion leads to overfitting.
A model that has overfit to the training data is robust towards outliers.
In the LASSO regression formula, if we set lambda to a very large value, our optimization would result in weights being 0.
